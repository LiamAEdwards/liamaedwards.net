I'm a Linux Site Reliability Engineer who started my career in a data centre where I did the usual crash cart, racking servers and attempting to cable everything nice and beautiful; not easy when you inherit live production racks that look like birds' nests.

I originally went into my data centre position with the dream of working in a Linux SRE/sysadmin position, and after about 3 years working in the data centre, I was recommended for an internal position as a Linux systems engineer and was accepted.

After a couple of years, I was offered the ability to switch to a Linux Site Reliability role which would allow me to write more code, mainly Python and Puppet, as well as work on a global scale.

My hobby of homelabbing, playing around with self-hosting and setting up things in VMs has kept me interested in learning more and having fun with Linux and software in general. I think without the ability to show what I have been up to on my homelab, I wouldn't have got the original offer for a Linux sysadmin position.

This blog serves as a way for me to document my ongoing projects, experiments, and learning experiences. Expect a mix of Linux-related content, self-hosting stuff, messing around and breaking my homelab, and a bit of randomness on the side.

Cheers,

Liam A Edwards
